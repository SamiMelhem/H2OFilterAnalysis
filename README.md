# H2O Filter Analysis

## Overview
H2O Filter Analysis is my internship project that focuses on analyzing water constituent data to provide filtration advice based on government guidelines. This application takes input data about water quality and outputs recommendations on the filtration frequency and methods.

## Features
- Data analysis based on input water constituent data for statistical analysis and decision-making.
- Reads in filtered datasets for trend analysis.
- Outputs data for assessing and proposing actions based on stats and counts.

## Installation
Before running the project, ensure you have the following packages installed:
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- numpy
- lifelines
- pymannkendall
- openpyxl
- csv
- glob
- iteratools

You can install these packages using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy
```

## Usage
To run the H2O Filter Analysis project:

1. Navigate to the `scripts` directory.
2. Run the `Complete_Script` file, which orchestrates the data analysis and filtration advice process:
```bash
python Complete_Script.py
```
